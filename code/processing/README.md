## `processing`

This folder should contain any scripts or notebooks used in the "processing" of data:

- Data scraping
- Data cleaning
- Data tidying

Once you have processed the data, you can export the final data, as .csv .tsv or .json, for example, to be used by scripts in the "analysis" folder.
