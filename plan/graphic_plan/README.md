## `Graphic Plan`

What will the final graphic look like? What sort of form will the data need to adopt to "fit" into the downstream visualization pipeline? 

Markdown files describing these details, and related details, should be placed here.

The ``sketches`` folder holds any sketches, diagrams, or scanned images relating to the graphic's structure or style.
