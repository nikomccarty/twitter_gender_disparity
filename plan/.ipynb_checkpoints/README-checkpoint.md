## `miscellaneous`

While the other directories in this repository are focused on code and data, this folder can serve as a journal, wherein you can write / save Markdown files relating to the various details of your project.

The ``data_plan`` folder contains markdown files relating to the "code strategy" to take a dataset, curate it, and tidy that dataset. These markdown files often take the form of a "list" of instructions, or approach to tackle this problem, as well as the relevant libraries to be used.

The ``graphic_plan`` folder contains markdown files relating to what the graphic should look like; these files may also include embedded files or sketches.

The ``narrative`` folder contains markdown files outlining how the data relates to a greater story, or fits into a narrative arc. These markdown files can contain tidbits from a story, quotes, or statistics relating to that larger narrative.
