### Data Sources
The data was originally found in an article published in _JAMA Internal Medicine_ (2019) called "Gender Differences in Twitter Use and Influence Among Health Policy and Health Services Researchers" by Zhu, J.M. _et al._ I contacted the corresponding author for access to the full dataset, which was listed on [GitHub here](https://github.com/rwerner-upenn/Gender-Differences-in-Twitter-Use-and-Influence-Among-Health-Policy-and-Health-ServicesResearchers/blob/master/twitter2018_Werner_JAMAIM_publicuse.dta).

The .dta file was converted to .csv with Pandas built-in functionality.
